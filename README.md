# SYNOPSIS

This library eases the handling of PUFFScion accounts, where accounts can be either external accounts
or contracts.

Note that the library is not meant to be used to handle your wallet accounts, use e.g. the web3-eth-personal package from the
`web3.js` library for that. This is just a semantic wrapper to ease the use of account data and provide functionality for reading and writing accounts from and to the PUFFScoin state trie.

Please refer to our organizational documentation for web3.js on PUFFScoin for more information. (http://puffscoin.leafycauldronapothecary.com/puffwiki/puffscoin-and-web3-js/)
